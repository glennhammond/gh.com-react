AI is useful in instructional design when it supports thinking rather than pretending to be the thinker.  
Here’s where I’m seeing the value.

## Where AI helps (a lot)

- **Analysis support**  
  Extract requirements, compare source documents, and surface gaps.
- **Drafting**  
  Scripts, outlines, scenario variants, and feedback options for a faster first pass.
- **Tone control**  
  Rewrite for different audiences (exec summary vs learner-facing).
- **Consistency**  
  Keep terminology, style, and structure consistent across a suite.
- **Quality checks**  
  Flag clarity issues, reading level problems, missing steps, and "this doesn’t make sense" moments.

## Where AI can hurt the work

- **Generic outcomes**  
  If you accept “best practice” filler, your learning becomes bland.
- **False confidence**  
  AI can be wrong while sounding certain. SMEs still matter.
- **Unsafe handling of sensitive content**  
  Learner data, student scenarios, HR issues.

## A simple way to keep the work sharp

1) Define the performance problem clearly (what people must do differently).  
2) Use AI to draft options, not decisions.  
3) Keep your design principles explicit (e.g., ADDIE-aligned, accessibility-aware, assessment mapped).  
4) Validate everything that claims to be factual.

If you treat AI as a collaborator that accelerates the messy early stage, you get the benefits without sacrificing quality.
