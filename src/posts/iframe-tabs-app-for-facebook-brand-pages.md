> **Archived (July 2013):** This post is kept live for historical reference and for anyone arriving via old links. The general idea was accurate at the time, but Facebook features change often - so steps/screens may no longer match what you see today.

Facebook Pages let you add **custom tabs** that load an external web page inside an iFrame. This is a handy way to drop in a simple landing page (newsletter sign-up, competition entry, promo, etc.) without sending people away from Facebook.

This post is written **as of July 2013**. Facebook changes features regularly, so if something looks different in the UI, the underlying approach is usually still the same.

## What you need
- A Facebook Page (where the tab will appear)
- A hosted web page (your tab content)
- A Facebook App (used to register the tab)

## 1) Build the tab page (your hosted content)
Create a simple HTML page and host it somewhere you control.

A few practical tips:
- Design for a tab width around **810px** (Facebook’s tab canvas)
- Keep the page height reasonable (or handle height with your layout)
- Use a clear headline and one main call-to-action
- Don’t rely on heavy scripts - keep it light

## Troubleshooting
If you get stuck, the quickest way to debug is to load the Page Tab URL directly in your browser first, then tackle Facebook settings second.
