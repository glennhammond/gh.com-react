title: I Highly Recommend xAPI for Learning Designers
summary: xAPI looks technical from the outside, but at its core it’s a simple language for describing learning behaviour. Here’s how to think about it as a designer — not a developer.

# xAPI Isn’t Scary — It’s a Superpower for Learning Designers

xAPI has a reputation for being something only developers care about. But once you understand what it really is — a structured way to track meaningful learning behaviour — it becomes one of the most empowering tools in your learning design toolkit.

You don’t need to be a developer.  
You don’t need to know code off by heart.  
You just need to understand the *story* behind the data.

## So what is xAPI, really?

At its simplest, xAPI is a structured way to say:

**Someone did something.**

That’s it. That’s the whole model.
actor — verb — object

Examples:

- Glenn *answered* Question 4  
- Priya *viewed* the Scenario Overview  
- Lee *rated* the module 4 stars  
- Sam *commented* “This is confusing”  

If you can describe a learning action, xAPI can capture it.

## Why designers should care

Here’s the truth: what makes a digital experience *good* is rarely the animations or the colour palette.

It’s whether it creates:

- insight  
- reflection  
- momentum  
- behaviour change  

xAPI lets you measure these things.

Not completion.  
Not page views.  
Not “time spent”.

Actual learning behaviour.

## Think in verbs, not screens

This is the shift that unlocks xAPI:

Stop thinking about the module as a sequence of slides.  
Start thinking about the *interactions* that matter.

For example:

- What are the moments that indicate understanding?
- What signals confusion?
- What actions show agency?
- What demonstrates growth?

If you identify these verbs early in design, your xAPI naturally becomes meaningful.

## You don’t need fancy dashboards (yet)

A simple LRS like Veracity Lite is enough to start building insight.

At the beginning, all you’re doing is:

- capturing events  
- checking they fire  
- checking the data is clean  
- adjusting structure  
- shaping patterns  

Dashboards come later.  
Understanding comes first.

## Build an xAPI habit

When you’re designing your next module, literally ask yourself:

- *What should I track here, beyond completion?*
- *What moment will tell me something useful?*
- *What makes this activity meaningful?*

Then add verbs that reflect those decisions.

A few favourites:

- *experienced*
- *answered*
- *completed*
- *scored*
- *selected*
- *commented*
- *rated*
- *reflected*

## Make it human

One thing I love about xAPI is that you can capture nuance.

You can store:

- the learner’s written reflection  
- a rating  
- an emotion  
- a choice pathway  
- a micro-decision in a branching scenario  

This is the stuff that makes learning *real*.

This is the stuff that helps improve design.

## Start simple

If you’re just beginning:

1. Track one quiz question  
2. Track one meaningful choice  
3. Track one reflection  
4. Check the data  
5. Improve it slightly  
6. Repeat  

As long as you’re iterating, you’re learning — and so are your learners.

xAPI isn’t scary.  
It’s just descriptive language.  
And once you understand its rhythm, it becomes one of the most powerful ways to bring clarity, insight, and creativity to your work.
