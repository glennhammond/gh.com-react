AI is already useful in just about everything - writing, design, analysis, admin. eLearning is no different.
Not as a magic ‘build the course’ button, but as a workflow accelerator.

## Faster sense-making from messy inputs

Most projects start the same way: a pile of policies, procedure docs, legacy course content, and SME feedback that arrives in three different formats.

AI is handy for getting to a clearer starting point:
- pulling out the real requirements
- highlighting contradictions or gaps
- drafting a sensible module structure
- turning a ramble into something you can actually storyboard

It doesn’t replace talking with SMEs - but it does mean I walk into those conversations with a sharper draft and better questions.

## Better first drafts - with a consistent voice

Where AI genuinely earns its keep is first-pass writing. Not final copy - first-pass.

It’s particularly useful for:
- scripts and narration drafts
- scenario dialogue options (including realistic wrong answers)
- feedback variations that aren’t copy-paste
- plain-English rewrites when the source material is heavy

The real win is speed and consistency - as long as you’ve got a style guide and you review for accuracy. I treat outputs as drafts, not decisions.

## Rapid prototyping and iteration

I’m a big fan of getting something on the table early - even if it’s rough.

AI helps me prototype faster:
- interaction approaches (especially for Storyline)
- quiz variants and question stems
- storyboard options
- microcopy for buttons, instructions, and hints

It shortens the blank-page phase and gives stakeholders something concrete to react to. That alone can save days.

## Smarter QA and accessibility checks

AI is also useful as a second set of eyes during QA. Not the final check - but a solid early pass.

It can help flag:
- unclear instructions
- inconsistent terminology
- missing feedback loops
- readability issues
- places where the learning flow doesn’t quite make sense

It won’t replace proper accessibility testing, but it catches a lot before you burn time polishing the wrong thing.

## Analytics that actually explain performance

This is where AI gets genuinely interesting - when it’s paired with xAPI.

If you’re capturing meaningful interaction data (not just completions), AI can help you:
- summarise what learners are actually doing
- spot sticking points and drop-off patterns
- turn raw statements into plain-English insights
- suggest practical design changes to test

For me, the value isn’t fancy dashboards - it’s being able to say to stakeholders: ‘Here’s what’s happening, here’s why it matters, and here’s what we’ll change next.’

## The non-negotiables

A few boundaries not to compromise on:

- **Accuracy** - AI can sound confident and be wrong. Validate anything that matters.
- **Privacy** - don’t paste sensitive learner, student, or staff data into tools you haven’t vetted.
- **Governance** - be clear on what AI can draft, what must be SME-approved, and what needs references.

Used well, AI doesn’t replace the designer. It clears the low-value friction so we can focus on decisions that actually improve learning.
