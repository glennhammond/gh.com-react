AI is already useful in eLearning - not as a magic “build the course” button, but as a workflow multiplier. The trick is knowing where it helps, and where you still need human judgement.

## 1) Faster sense-making from messy inputs

Policies, procedure docs, SMEs who speak in tangents - AI can help you:
- extract the *actual requirements*
- identify contradictions
- propose a clean module outline

You still validate with SMEs, but you start from a stronger draft.

## 2) Better first drafts (with consistent voice)

AI is great at producing:
- first-pass scripts
- scenario dialogue options
- feedback variations
- “plain English” rewrites

The win is speed *and* consistency - as long as you apply a style guide and review for accuracy.

## 3) Rapid prototyping and iteration

AI helps you prototype:
- interaction ideas
- quiz variants
- storyboard options
- micro-copy for UI

This shortens the “blank page” phase and gives stakeholders something concrete to react to.

## 4) Smarter QA and accessibility checks

AI can flag:
- unclear instructions
- inconsistent terminology
- missing feedback loops
- readability issues

It won’t replace a real accessibility check, but it catches a lot early.

## 5) Analytics that actually explain performance

This is where AI gets interesting *when paired with xAPI*. If you capture meaningful interaction data, AI can help you:
- summarise patterns
- spot sticking points
- suggest design fixes
- generate insights for stakeholders

## The non-negotiables

- **Accuracy**: AI can confidently hallucinate. Treat outputs as drafts.
- **Privacy**: don’t paste sensitive learner or student info into tools you haven’t vetted.
- **Governance**: set boundaries - what AI can write, what must be SME-approved, what must be referenced.

Used well, AI doesn’t “replace the designer”. It clears the low-value friction so you can focus on decisions that actually improve learning.
