A Storyline template isn’t just a pretty player and a few slides. It’s a build system: consistent layout, interaction patterns, accessibility defaults, and publish-ready settings.

## Step 1 - Define your baseline standards
- 16:9, 1920×1080
- type scale and spacing rules
- contrast and focus states
- keyboard expectations (where possible)

## Step 2 - Build master slides like components
Create masters for:
- title/intro
- content + image
- quote/callout
- activity
- knowledge check
- feedback states

## Step 3 - Create reusable interaction patterns
e.g. tabs, accordions, process steps, scenario choice, drag-and-drop.

## Step 4 - Lock down text styles and colours
Use Storyline’s text styles properly. Avoid “manual formatting drift”.

## Step 5 - Standardise variables and naming
Consistent naming makes debugging bearable:
- v_attemptCount
- v_scene
- v_score
- etc.

## Step 6 - Publish settings + QA checklist
One checklist, every time: fonts, scaling, audio levels, focus order, completion logic, reporting identifiers.

_TODO: add a downloadable checklist and a sample slide naming convention._
